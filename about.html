            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Lotanna Obiekwe, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems with a minor in Information Technology  at Kennesaw State University. Throughout my time here, Ive developed a deep interest in business analysis and UX/UI design, I have dedicated my academic career to understanding how technology can improve business operations and enhance user experiences. My journey through KSU has been a remarkable blend of academic challenges, real-world projects, and personal growth, shaping me into the professional I am today.</p>
            <p>In addition to my studies, I am actively involved in various student organizations at KSU, including the Coles Ambassador for Student Success team and serving as a Student Leadership Assistant with the Student Leadership Department. These roles have allowed me to develop leadership skills, engage with my peers, and participate in initiatives that foster community and collaboration among students. Being part of these organizations has enriched my university experience, enabling me to network with professionals and gain insights into industry trends. Outside of academics, I have a passion for cooking, experimenting with various cuisines and flavors. A fun fact about me is my love for spicy foods and my enthusiasm for all things sour! Whether it's whipping up a spicy curry or enjoying a tangy lemon infused dessert, I find joy in the vibrant flavors that cooking brings to life.</p>
            <p>My future goal is to continue growing my skills in business analysis and user experience design,the long-term aspiration of stepping into leadership roles within the tech industry. Iâ€™m excited to see where this journey takes me and how I can contribute to the evolving landscape of technology and business.
